```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

library(tidyverse)
library(janitor)
library(here)
```

- Use here() to read in data with a system agnostic file path
- Use janitor::clean_names() to make the columns more coder friendly

```{r}
ces <- read.csv(here("data", "ces3demographics.csv")) %>% # establish file path
  clean_names() # update column names to lower snake case
```

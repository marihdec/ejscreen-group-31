```

- Use here() to read in data with a system agnostic file path
- Use janitor::clean_names() to make the columns more coder friendly

```{r}
ces <- read.csv(here("data", "ces3demographics.csv")) %>% # establish file path
  clean_names() # update column names to lower snake case
```

```{r Abigail}
# create a basic ggplot2 scatter plot graph showing `white` % on x-axis and CalEnviroScreen pollution burden score `ces_3_0_score` on the y-axis. 
ggplot(data = ces, aes(x = white, y = ces_3_0_score)) + 
  geom_hex() +
  labs(x = "% white", y = "pollution burden score", title = "Pollution burden score by white population density")
